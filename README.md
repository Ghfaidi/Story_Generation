# Sherlock Holmes Story Generation
This repository contains a TensorFlow-based project that generates Sherlock Holmes stories given a starting sentence.
The model is built using bidirectional LSTM architecture to generate text in the style of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous detective, Sherlock Holmes.
Although the resulting text is not coherent enough, if we train this on more and more text with a larger model with maybe multiple days of training on a high-speed computer, this is going to give some decent results over time.
